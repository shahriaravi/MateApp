## Why Mate?

In a world of bloated finance apps that harvest your data, Mate offers a refreshing alternative. It's built on three core principles: clarity, privacy, and control. We believe managing your money should be an insightful, streamlined, and personal process.

**Mate is for you if you:**
- Appreciate **minimalist, functional design** inspired by the Nothing‚Ñ¢ aesthetic.
- Value **true privacy**. Your data is offline-first and stays on your device. No accounts, no servers, no clouds.
- Need powerful tools like **multi-wallet tracking, budgeting, and loan management** presented in the simplest way possible.

Mate is more than an expense tracker; it's a statement. It's your financial awareness tool, deconstructed to its essential form.
