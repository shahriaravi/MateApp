# Mate - Terms and Conditions

**Effective Date:** 28/10/2025

Welcome to Mate! By downloading, installing, or using this application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

### 1. The App is Provided "As Is"

Mate is currently in a **beta phase**. This means the App is provided "as is," without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. We are working hard to make it a reliable financial companion, but we cannot guarantee that it will always be free of bugs, errors, inaccuracies, or interruptions. You agree that you use the App at your own sole risk.

### 2. No Financial Advice

Mate is a financial tracking and awareness tool. It does **not** provide financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. The calculations, budget tracking, and "What If?" scenarios are for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional financial advice. You are solely responsible for your own financial decisions and research.

### 3. Data Responsibility & Security

Mate is an offline-first application. All of your financial data is stored exclusively on your device.

- **You are responsible for your data.** This includes regularly backing up your data using the "Export Data" feature.
- **We are not responsible for data loss.** If your device is lost, stolen, damaged, or if you delete the app, your data will be permanently lost unless you have a backup. We have no access to your data and no way to recover it for you.
- The App Lock feature relies on your device's native security (Passcode, Face ID, Fingerprint). You are responsible for securing your device. We are not liable for any unauthorized access that results from a compromised device.

### 4. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the developer of Mate (Byontrid) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
(a) your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the App;
(b) any bugs, viruses, or errors in the software;
(c) the permanent deletion or loss of your data.

### 5. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will provide notice of any major changes within the App. By continuing to use the App after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

**By using Mate, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.**
