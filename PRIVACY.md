# Privacy Policy for Mate

**Last Updated: 26/10/2025**

Thank you for choosing Mate. Your privacy and the security of your financial data are our highest priorities. This policy explains what information we handle and, more importantly, what we **do not**.

Our core principle is simple: **Your data is yours. It stays on your device.**

---

### 1. Data We Do Not Collect

Mate is designed to be a private, offline-first application. We do **not** collect, store, view, or have access to any of your personal financial information. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   Your transaction amounts, notes, or categories.
-   Your wallet names or balances.
-   Your budgets, loans, or subscriptions.
-   Any data related to your financial reports or insights.

All of the financial data you enter into Mate is stored exclusively in a secure, local SQLite database on your own device. It never leaves your phone unless you manually export it.

### 2. Data We Do Collect (Anonymous Survey)

To help us understand our users and improve our app, we ask one optional question during the onboarding process: **"How did you hear about Mate?"**

-   **What We Collect:** We collect only your selected answer(s) from the survey (e.g., "Discord," "YouTube"), your device model name (e.g., "Pixel 7").
-   **How It's Used:** This information is sent anonymously to a private Google Sheet. It helps us understand which communities our users come from so we can focus our efforts.
-   **It Is Not Linked to You:** This survey data is completely separate from your financial data and is not used to identify you personally.

### 3. Permissions We Request

Mate requests a minimal set of permissions to function correctly:

-   **Storage / Media Access (`WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` / `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`):** This permission is required only when you choose to use the "Backup" or "Export to CSV" features to save a file to your device, or when you attach a receipt image to a transaction. The app does not automatically access any other files.
-   **Biometrics / Face ID (`USE_BIOMETRIC`):** This permission is used for the App Lock feature. The authentication is handled entirely by your phone's secure operating system. We never receive or store your biometric data.

### 4. Data Security

Because your data is stored locally, you have full control over it. We recommend using the app's backup feature regularly to prevent data loss if your device is lost, damaged, or reset. We are not responsible for the loss of locally stored data.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
