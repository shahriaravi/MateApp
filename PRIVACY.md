# Mate - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 28/10/2025

Your privacy is the foundation of Mate. Our philosophy is simple: **what's yours is yours.** Your financial data is sensitive, and we believe it should never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to move it.

### 1. Data We Do NOT Collect

Mate is an offline-first application. We do **not** have user accounts. We do **not** have our own servers. Therefore, we do not collect, store, view, or have any access to:

- Your name, email address, or any other personal identifier.
- Your transaction details, amounts, or notes.
- Your wallet names or balances.
- Your budget information.
- Your loan or subscription details.
- Your device contacts, photos, or other personal files.

All of the above data is stored exclusively in a secure, encrypted database file on your personal device.

### 2. Data We Collect (Optional & Anonymous)

During the initial onboarding process, we ask for your feedback. This is the **only** time we transmit any data, and it is sent anonymously to a private Discord channel for our development team to improve the app. This data includes:

- The sources you selected for how you heard about Mate.
- Your device's general model name (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro," "Pixel 8"), with no unique identifiers.

This data is used solely to understand our user base and prioritize features.

### 3. Permissions We Request

Mate may request the following permissions, but only when you use a feature that requires it:

- **Notifications:** To send you scheduled reminders for upcoming subscriptions and loan payments. This feature is off by default and can be toggled in settings. We do not use notifications for marketing.
- **Biometric Authentication (Face ID / Fingerprint):** To secure the app with an App Lock. This feature is optional and your biometric data is never transmitted; it is handled securely by your device's operating system.

### 4. Your Data, Your Control

- **Export:** You can export your entire database to a human-readable JSON file at any time.
- **Delete:** You can permanently delete all of your data from the app at any time via the settings menu. This action is irreversible and completely wipes the app's database from your device.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this policy in a way that affects your data, we will notify you within the app before the changes take effect. Our core promise of being an offline-first, private application will not change.
